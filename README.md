# EventTrackerProject

##Overview
- This is my week 12 event tracker project. This is the first project in which I built, mapped and tested a single table database using Spring Data JPA tools and RESTful services.
- Typically, in the past we were using DAO Implementation methods to write the business logic for our program. This is the first week in which implemented a JPA repository, used the methods provided by the database to make basic queries, and even customized a few queries.

##Lessons used
- Object Relational mapping
- SQL database
- MAMP
- Spring Data JPA
- Repositories
- Query methods
- Object oriented programming
- Controllers
- gradle
- Handling requests
- Postman
##How to run - Instructions
- This application is not going to be deployed until after implementing javascript logic as well as structuring the front end user experience.
- Most of the backend is finished and tested using postman to make sure the paths/methods and services are working properly.
